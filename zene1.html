                <p> FloRida <br>
                Alexandra girl I know what you like <br>
                (Bad boys, bad boys...) <br> </p>
                
                <p>Oh, oh <br>
                Hey, yeah </p>
                
                <P>
                Some people call them players <br>
                But I'm far from terrified <br>
                'Cause somehow I'm drawn to danger <br>
                And have been all of my life <br>
                It feels my heart's divided <br>
                Halfway between wrong and right <br>
                I know I'm playing with fire <br>
                But I don't mind </p>
                <p>
                Yeah the bad boys are always catching my eye <br>
                (Ooh way, ooh wah) <br>
                I said the bad boys are always spinning my mind <br>
                (Ooh way, ooh wah) <br>
                Even though I know they're no good for me <br>
                It's the risk I take for the chemistry <br>
                With the bad boys always catching my eye <br>
                (Ooh way, ooh way, ooh wah) <br>
                O-o-o-ooh, bad boys
                </p>
                Some think it's complicated <br>
                But they're straight up fun for me (o-oh) <br>
                I don't need no explanation <br>
                It's nothing more than what you see (here) <br>
                My heart still feels…
