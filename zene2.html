                    <p>You lift me up <br>
                    Then knock me down <br>
                    I'm never sure just what to feel when you're around <br> </p>

                    <p>
                    I speak my heart <br>
                    But don't know why <br>
                    'Cause you don't ever really say what's on your mind <br></p>

                    <p>
                    It's like I'm walking on broken glass <br>
                    I wanna know but I don't wanna ask <br></p>

                    <p>
                    So say you love me <br>
                    Or say you'll leave me<br>
                    Don't let the silence do the talking<br></p>

                    <p>
                    Just say you want me<br>
                    Or you don't need me<br>
                    Do't let the silence do the talking<br></p>

                        <p>
                    You let me in<br>
                    But then sometimes<br>
                    Your empty eyes make me feel so cold inside<br>
                    When I'm with you<br>
                    It's like rolling dice<br>
                    Don't know when or how you're gonna make me cry<br></p>

                    <p>
                    So say you love me<br>
                    Or say you'll leave me<br>
                    Don't let the silence do the talking<br></p>

                    <p>
                    Just say you want me<br>
                    Or you don't need me<br>
                    Don't let the silence do the talking<br>
                    
                        <p>
                    It's killing me<br>
                    (The silence)<br>
                    It's killing me<br></p>
